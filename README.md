# Classifying-Sound-snippets-using-CNN
Use the waveform of different voice snipped using CNN to identify voice commands

Steps adopted
1. Collect repository of waves with 'n' classes voice commands
2. Convert these wav files into different representations 
3. Convert into images 
4. Train the model with these different commands as differnt classes using simple CNN
5. Predict a new wav file to test which class it belongs to
